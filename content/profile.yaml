  about: |
    I'm a Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari. My research interests are in Computer Graphics and Geometry Processing, focusing on hexahedral mesh generation.
    I love to solve problems and develop stuff, even more if it is related to the 3D world.
